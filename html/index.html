            <p>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA  <br>
            has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black  <br>
            highlighters.
            </p>
            <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred <br>
            by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that <br>
            began at the agency's inception in 1947.
            </p>
            <p> CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several <br>
                historic events, such as:

            <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
