// # Assignment:

// * Outside of Scrimba (VS Code or another editor), create another HTML page from complete
//  scratch (no cheating!) and connect a JS file to it
// * Create an <h1> element and give it an ID, but don't put any text inside
// * In JavaScript, select your <h1> element and give it some text
//     * You may likely have to look up how to do this. This is a great chance to practice using
//  Google for finding answers to your coding questions!
// * Open your HTML page in a browser and check if your text shows up!
//     * If you're using VS Code, you can use the Live Preview extension to quickly open the HTML
//  file in a browser.

// var addText = document.getElementById('addText')
// console.log('addText')

document.getElementById('addText').innerHTML = 'Welcome to the get element by id assignment.'
