<!-- # Assignment:

* Outside of Scrimba (VS Code or another editor), create another HTML page from complete scratch (no cheating!) and connect a JS file to it
* Create an <h1> element and give it an ID, but don't put any text inside
* In JavaScript, select your <h1> element and give it some text
    * You may likely have to look up how to do this. This is a great chance to practice using Google for finding answers to your coding questions!
* Open your HTML page in a browser and check if your text shows up!
    * If you're using VS Code, you can use the Live Preview extension to quickly open the HTML file in a browser.
