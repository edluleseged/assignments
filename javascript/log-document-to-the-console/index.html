<!-- # Assignment:

* Outside of Scrimba (in an editor like Visual Studio Code), build a basic HTML page from scratch (no copy/pasting!)
    * Try to do so without looking at any past work if you can.
* Connect a JavaScript file to the page
* Log the `document` to the console. (Shows up as <> in Scrimba)
* Open the HTML page in a browser (can simply double click the file on your computer OR use the Live Server VS Code extension), open the developer tools, navigate to the "console" portion of the developer tools, and look what actually got logged to the console. -->
