// Loop Olympics
// 18 OCTOBER 2017
// The exercise will get progressively harder and hard. You at least should get one medal, but feel free to go the extra mile!

// Preliminaries
// Write a for loop that prints to the console the numbers 0 through 9.

// for (var i=0; i<10;i++){
//   console.log(i)
// }


// Write a for loop that prints to the console 9 through 0.

for(var i=9;i>0; i--){
  console.log(i)
}


// Write a for loop that prints these fruits to the console.

// var fruit = ["banana", "orange", "apple", "kiwi"]

// console.log(fruits.length)

// console.log(fruit[0])
// console.log(fruit[1])
// console.log(fruit[2])
// console.log(fruit[3])



// Bronze Medal
// Write a for loop that will push the numbers 0 through 9 to an array.


// Write a for loop that prints to the console only even numbers 0 through 100.

// for(var i=0; i<100; i++){
//     if ([i] % 2 === 0){ 
//         console.log([i] + 'is even')
//     }
//     else if ( [i] % 2 === 1){
//         console.log([i] + 'is odd')
//     }
//   }
    

// Write a for loop that will push every other fruit to an array.
// var fruit = ["banana", "orange", "apple", "kiwi", "pear", "peach"]

Silver Medal
Write a loop that will print out all the names of the people of the people array
Write a loop that pushes the names into a names array, and the occupations into an occupations array.
Write a loop that pushes every other name to an array starting with the first person, in this case "Harrison Ford", and every other occupation to another array starting with, in this case, "Singer".
var peopleArray = [
  {
    name: "Harrison Ford",
    occupation: "Actor"
  },
  {
    name: "Justin Bieber",
    occupation: "Singer"
  },
  {
    name: "Vladimir Putin",
    occupation: "Politician"
  },
  {
    name: "Oprah",
    occupation: "Entertainer"
  }
]


Gold Medal - Nesting
Create an array that mimics a grid like the following using nested for loops:
[[0, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 0], 
[0, 0, 0]]
2.Create an array that mimics a grid like the following using nested for loops:

[[0, 0, 0], 
[1, 1, 1], 
[2, 2, 2]]
3.Create an array that mimics a grid like the following using nested for loops:

[[0, 1, 2], 
[0, 1, 2], 
[0, 1, 2]]
Given a grid like the previous ones, write a nested for loop that would change every number to an x.
var grid = [["x", ...], 
            ["x", ...], 
            ["x",...], ...]
